# ðŸŒŒ cobaltnext.nvim

A Neovim colorscheme based on the Ghostty **cobaltnext-dark** palette.

## Installation (LazyVim / lazy.nvim)

```lua
{
  "panjakub/cobaltnext.nvim",
  name = "cobaltnext",
  priority = 1000,
  config = function()
    vim.cmd.colorscheme("cobaltnext_dark")
  end,
}
```

*Disclaimer*: Purely vibe-coded with some minor manual tweaks.
I just like the ghostty theme and I wanted to use that in Neovim.
I may improve that myself and I'm happy to respond to any issues and pull requests.

*Disclaimer 2*: I'm borderline colorblind so the color names are my best guesses.
I'm happy to fix them to what they're actually are if you tell me the colors.
